HTTPSYS: User-space implementation of HTTP.SYS
==============================================

Version 1.2.0 dd 17-02-2025
---------------------------
- Completed the implementation of WebSockets. See the "Marlin" project for more details
  and a test server "MarlinServer" demo project
- Completed the implementation of UNICODE.
- Minor parameter improvements and implementations:
  o MaxConnections 1024 (1024 - 2031616)
    Overrides the MaxConnections calculation in the driver. This is primarily a function of memory.
  o MaxEndpoints (0)  (0 - 1024)
    Number of current endpoint objects that are permitted. 
    The default value of zero implies that the maximum is computed from available memory.
  o MaxFieldLength (16384)
    Sets an upper limit for each header. See MaxRequestBytes. 
    This limit translates to approximately 32k characters for a URL.  
  o MaxRequestBytes (16384) 256 - 16777216 (16MB) bytes
    Determines the upper limit for the total size of the Request line and the headers. 
    Its default setting is 16KB. 
    If this value is lower than MaxFieldLength, the MaxFieldLength value is adjusted.

Version 1.1.0 dd 27-12-2024
---------------------------
1)  Implementation of asynchroneous I/O with IOCP (I/O Completion Ports)
2)  Implementation of websockets for the async MarlinServer
3)  Synced with the Marlin project

Version 1.0.4 dd 31-12-2018
---------------------------
1) Changed RequestQueue handle to a real HANDLE. In preparation of Async I/O

Version 1.0.3 dd 30-12-2018
---------------------------
1) Better checking of handles before converting them into object pointers. This is done for:
   - ServerSession
   - RequestQueue
   - UrlGroup
   - Request
   All Http* API calls have been altered to perform these checks
2) Fixed a bug in the "ExtraStop" event in the "PlainSocket"

Version 1.0.2 dd 29-12-2018
---------------------------
1) Implemented registry setting "DisableServerHeader".
   This key controls how http.sys behaves with regards to appending the http response header "Server" 
   for responses that it sends to clients. 
   A value of 0, which is the default value, will use the header value the application provides to http.sys, 
                 or will append the default value of ‘Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0’ to the response header. 
   A value of 1 will not append the "Server" header for responses generated 
                 by http.sys (responses ending in 400, 503, and other status codes). 
   A value of 2 will prevent http.sys from appending a ‘Server’ header to the response. 
                 If a 'Server' header is present on the response, it will not be removed, 
                 if one is not present, it will not be added.  


Version 1.0.1 dd 29-12-2018
---------------------------
1) More property functions for both UrlGroup and Server session
2) Waiting for demand start and waiting for disconnect are implemented.

Version 1.0 dd 27-12-2018
-------------------------
All functionality for stand-alone web servers like Marlin are working
Total testset on client/server sides are working.
