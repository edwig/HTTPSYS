HTTPSYS: User-space implementation of HTTP.SYS
==============================================

Version 1.0.3 dd 30-12-2018
---------------------------
1) Better checking of handles before converting them into object pointers. This is done for:
   - ServerSession
   - RequestQueue
   - UrlGroup
   - Request
   All Http* API calls have been altered to perform these checks
2) Fixed a bug in the "ExtraStop" event in the "PlainSocket"

Version 1.0.2 dd 29-12-2018
---------------------------
1) Implemented registry setting "DisableServerHeader".
   This key controls how http.sys behaves with regards to appending the http response header "Server" 
   for responses that it sends to clients. 
   A value of 0, which is the default value, will use the header value the application provides to http.sys, 
                 or will append the default value of ‘Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0’ to the response header. 
   A value of 1 will not append the "Server" header for responses generated 
                 by http.sys (responses ending in 400, 503, and other status codes). 
   A value of 2 will prevent http.sys from appending a ‘Server’ header to the response. 
                 If a 'Server' header is present on the response, it will not be removed, 
                 if one is not present, it will not be added.  


Version 1.0.1 dd 29-12-2018
---------------------------
1) More property functions for both UrlGroup and Server session
2) Waiting for demand start and waiting for disconnect are implemented.

Version 1.0 dd 27-12-2018
-------------------------
All functionality for stand-alone web servers like Marlin are working
Total testset on client/server sides are working.
